        {"step": 1, "speaker": "agent", "text": "Hello, thank you for contacting our support. How can I assist you today?"},
        {"step": 2, "speaker": "customer", "text": "Hi, I'm considering buying an iPhone 14 but have heard mixed reviews. Can you provide some clear details?"},
        {"step": 3, "speaker": "agent", "text": "Of course! The iPhone 14 comes with a 6.1-inch display and A16 Bionic chip. However, some users find it similar to the previous model. Do you have specific concerns?"},
        {"step": 4, "speaker": "customer", "text": "Yes, what storage options are available, and are they cost-effective?"},
        {"step": 5, "speaker": "agent", "text": "The iPhone 14 is available in 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB options. The pricing often feels premium for the higher storage models."},
        {"step": 6, "speaker": "customer", "text": "I think the 256GB might be overpriced. What's the cost?"},
        {"step": 7, "speaker": "agent", "text": "The 256GB version is priced at $999, which is steep, but it includes enhanced features. Are you interested in any specific color that might change your mind?"},
        {"step": 8, "speaker": "customer", "text": "What colors are available?"},
        {"step": 9, "speaker": "agent", "text": "It's available in Midnight, Starlight, Product Red, Blue, and Green. The Blue has been particularly popular."},
        {"step": 10, "speaker": "customer", "text": "I like the Blue one, but is it really worth the upgrade from iPhone 13?"},
        {"step": 11, "speaker": "agent", "text": "That’s a valid concern. The improvements are incremental and might not justify the upgrade for every user."},
        {"step": 12, "speaker": "customer", "text": "I see. How long would the delivery take if I decide to go ahead?"},
        {"step": 13, "speaker": "agent", "text": "Delivery typically takes 3-5 business days, but there have been some delays recently."},
        {"step": 14, "speaker": "customer", "text": "Okay, I’ll think about it. What payment methods do you accept if I decide to purchase?"},
        {"step": 15, "speaker": "agent", "text": "We accept credit cards, debit cards, and PayPal. Let me know if you have any other questions."},
        {"step": 16, "speaker": "customer", "text": "I’ll use my credit card. Can you assure me that the payment process is secure?"},
        {"step": 17, "speaker": "agent", "text": "Absolutely, I can assure you that our payment process is secure. I'll send you a payment link now."},
        {"step": 18, "speaker": "customer", "text": "I’ve made the payment. When can I expect a confirmation?"},
        {"step": 19, "speaker": "agent", "text": "You should receive a confirmation email within the next few hours. If it doesn’t arrive, please let us know."},
        {"step": 20, "speaker": "customer", "text": "Lastly, I’m worried about the battery life. What can you tell me about that?"},
        {"step": 21, "speaker": "agent", "text": "The battery life is generally good, but like any device, it depends on usage patterns. If you experience issues, we’re here to help."},
        {"step": 22, "speaker": "customer", "text": "Thanks for the information. I’ll need some time to think it over."},
        {"step": 23, "speaker": "agent", "text": "Of course, take all the time you need. Feel free to contact us with any more questions. Have a great day!"}
